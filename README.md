## Features

This project is incorporating the following features that might come in handy for real-life projects:

- **.prettierrc** config file to override any local prettier configurations. This helps maintaining the same formatting across the development team.
- **.eslintrc.json** contains this project's linting configuration, also enforced by VSCode's ESLint plugin
- **.husky** this configuration allows us to run a particular script before commiting any code. In my case, I run `lint` to make sure the code adheres to standards.
- **jest** the `jest-setup.ts` and `babel.config.js` config files were added to support jest as test runner. Related libraries were added and the `package.json` file includes jest-related config.
